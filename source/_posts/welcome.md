Hi, I'm Kyle.

I build AI systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact. Currently exploring how multiple AI agents can reason together under constraints.

## What I'm Working On

- EdgeSwarm: Multi-agent inference systems for edge devices
- Exploring model preloading strategies to eliminate cold-start latency
- Designing scheduling strategies for single vs multi-model collaboration

Stay tuned for more updates.
